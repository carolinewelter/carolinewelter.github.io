I am committed to creating a dynamic classroom environment where students engage deeply with economic theory and real-world applications. My teaching emphasizes active learning, structured clarity, and responsiveness to student needs. I incorporate classroom experiments, interactive tools such as [Kahoot](https://kahoot.com/) and [Pear Deck](https://www.peardeck.com/), and project-based assignments to make economics accessible and meaningful.  

I also take a varied approach to assessment, using a mix of exams, quizzes, group projects, and alternative participation formats for students with restrictions. My goal is to ensure that every student has multiple pathways to succeed, while maintaining academic rigor.

## Pedagogical Tools
- **Active learning simulations**:  
  - *Pit Market Game* (Holt, 1996): live buyer–seller simulation demonstrating price equilibrium.  
  - *Paper Bag Trading Game*: illustrates gains from voluntary trade.  
  - *Elasticity with Rubber Bands*: simple visual analogy.  
  - *Tennis Ball Production Game*: demonstrates diminishing marginal returns.

## Student Feedback
I actively use mid-semester surveys and official evaluations to improve my teaching. Here are selected student comments on my instruction:

> *"Dr. Welter did an amazing job for her first semester teaching, she was able to explain the topics. She definitely improved over the semester as we gave her feedback and listened to what we asked her to help us. When we asked for practice tests for the exam, she took time out of her day to make us a practice test. She has done an amazing job throughout the semester teaching us all the topics we needed to know."*

> *"Caroline Welter was the best teacher I have ever had before. She was so helpful and always available during all hours to help me and all my questions."*

> *"My professor was wonderful and made me switch my major to economics because I enjoyed the course thoroughly."*

> *"I enjoyed this course. The professor was able to teach the topics in various, engaging ways that kept our attention throughout the entire lecture. She was willing to work with students if they needed accommodations for something. The one piece of advice I would give is to add graded quizzes to the course. That way students can have opportunities to boost their grade and take away some of
the stress of exams. Also, these quizzes could serve as a knowledge check so students can get an idea of what they know and what they need to study before the bigger exams."*
