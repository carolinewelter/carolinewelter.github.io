My research lies at the intersection of health economics, regional and urban economics, and public policy. I investigate how health disparities, access to care, and well-being policies unfold across space and socioeconomic lines. I am particularly interested in the heterogeneous effects of public programs and structural barriers that disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, including those in rural areas and communities facing increased challenges due to the shift to online services and the effects of automation. My work emphasizes how place and policy interact to shape program participation, labor market outcomes, and health.

## Job Market Paper
**The Impact of SSA Field Office Closures on Disability Program Participation**  

This paper estimates the impact of Social Security Administration (SSA) field office closures on participation in federal disability benefit programs. I exploit the uniform, nationwide closure of over 1,200 SSA field offices during the COVID-19 lockdown period as a natural experiment. Using a difference-in-differences framework, I compare changes in the number of newly enrolled disabled beneficiaries across ZIP codes with and without a local SSA office. The results show that, on average, closures reduced the number of new disability beneficiaries by 2.3%. The effects are significantly larger in non-metropolitan areas (-9.4%) and in communities with low internet access (-3.5%), suggesting that limited digital infrastructure exacerbated the barriers imposed by the loss of in-person services. These findings provide evidence that in-person administrative access plays a vital role in facilitating disability program enrollment, particularly for vulnerable and digitally underserved populations.
