My research lies at the intersection of health economics, regional and urban economics, and public policy. I examine how economic inequalities, health disparities, access to care, and well-being policies play out across urban and rural contexts, with particular attention to elderly and minority populations. I am especially interested in the heterogeneous effects of public programs and the administrative barriers that disproportionately impact vulnerable groups, including rural communities and those facing heightened challenges from the digital divide and automation. Across this work, I emphasize how place and policy interact to shape program participation, labor market outcomes, and health.

## Job Market Paper

**The Impact of SSA Field Office Closures on Disability Program Participation**  

This paper estimates the impact of Social Security Administration (SSA) field office closures on participation in federal disability benefit programs. I exploit the uniform, nationwide closure of over 1,200 SSA field offices during the COVID-19 lockdown period as a natural experiment. Using a difference-in-differences framework, I compare changes in the number of enrolled disabled beneficiaries across ZIP codes with and without a local SSA office. The results show that, on average, closures reduced the number of disability beneficiaries by 2.3%. The effects are significantly larger in non-metropolitan areas (-9.4%) and in communities with low internet access (-6.65%), suggesting that limited digital infrastructure exacerbated the barriers imposed by the loss of in-person services. These findings provide evidence that in-person administrative access plays a vital role in facilitating disability program enrollment, particularly for vulnerable and digitally underserved populations.
