Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ 

I am a 3th year Ph.D. Student (Graduate Research Assistant) in Economics at [West Virginia University](https://www.wvu.edu/), and a member of the [Regional Research Institute](https://rri.wvu.edu/). In addition, I hold both a M.Sc. and B.Sc. degrees also in Economics. 

Throughout my career, I have developed research related
to the fields of Urban and Regional Economics, and now giving more emphasis to its connection with Health Economics , giving me experience in:

- Causal Inference Methods
- Applied Economics
- 
-

<!-- My current goal is to conduct further research on the design, modeling, control and assessment of chemical processes. Lastly, I have experience working with the industry, mainly the oil and gas, petrochemical and energy sectors. -->
