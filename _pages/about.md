<!-- 
**Hello there, welcome to my website!**

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics, currently in my 5th year at [West Virginia University](https://www.wvu.edu/). I hold both M.A. and B.Sc. degrees in the field. Throughout my academic journey, my research focus has revolved around the domains of Health Economics, with a particular emphasis on its connection with Urban and Regional Economics.
<!-- My academic pursuits have also earned me the esteemed position of a Graduate Research Assistant at the renowned [Regional Research Institute](https://rri.wvu.edu/). 

I have been employing rigorous Causal Inference Methods to my research. The outcome of these research has been the publication of several research papers, which I am excited to share with you on this platform. Here, you will find an extensive collection of my published works, along with a detailed curriculum vitae that outlines my academic accomplishments, research contributions, and professional experiences.


Here are my statements:

**Hello there, welcome to my website!**

I am a **Ph.D. candidate in Economics** at **West Virginia University**, currently in my 5th year and on the **2025â€“26 job market**.  

My research lies at the intersection of **Health Economics** and **Urban & Regional Economics**, with a focus on how place and policy design shape access to public programs, health, and economic opportunity. Methodologically, I use **causal inference with administrative, spatial, and survey data** to study distributional effects across rural and digitally underserved populations.

## Featured: Job Market Paper
**The Impact of SSA Field Office Closures on Disability Program Participation**

This paper estimates how the nationwide closures of Social Security Administration (SSA) field offices during the COVID-19 lockdown affected participation in disability benefit programs. I exploit these closures as a natural experiment using a difference-in-differences design.  

Closures reduced new disability beneficiaries by **2.3% overall**, with larger declines in **non-metropolitan areas (â€“9.4%)** and **low-internet communities (â€“3.5%)**, showing that in-person administrative access remains vital for vulnerable populations.
