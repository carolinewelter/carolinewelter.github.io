Greetings and welcome to my website!

I am a Ph.D. student in Economics, currently in my 3rd year of doctoral studies at [West Virginia University](https://www.wvu.edu/). My academic pursuits have also earned me the esteemed position of a Graduate Research Assistant at the renowned [Regional Research Institute](https://rri.wvu.edu/). In addition, I hold both M.A. and B.Sc. degrees in the field. Throughout my academic journey, my research focus has revolved around the domains of Urban and Regional Economics, with a particular emphasis on its connection with Health Economics.

My scholarly endeavors have led me to explore diverse topics, including Input-Output Modelling to tackle regional problems in Brazil as well as Applied Econometrics. More recently I have been employing rigorous Causal Inference Methods to my research. The outcome of these endeavors has been the publication of several research papers, which I am excited to share with you on this platform. Here, you will find an extensive collection of my published works, along with a detailed curriculum vitae that outlines my academic accomplishments, research contributions, and professional experiences.

<!-- My current goal is to conduct further research on the design, modeling, control and assessment of chemical processes. Lastly, I have experience working with the industry, mainly the oil and gas, petrochemical and energy sectors. -->
